[h1][b] Vector Thrust [/b][/h1]
[b] put your thrusters on rotors! [/b]

if you have [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=655948251&searchtext=control+module] Control Module [/url] installed in the world, it will just work. [b] THIS IS OPTIONAL [/b]

[h1] MAIN SETUP [/h1]
1. Load the script into a programmable block (click 'Edit', not 'Custom Data', then 'Browse Workshop'), then click 'Check Code' and 'Remember and Exit'
2. [strike] run the programmable block [/strike] it should be already running. if its on standby mode, you will have to pass the %standby argument
3. setup your buttons.. either use 'Control Module' by DIGI or make your cockpit buttons with various actions. you will have to use the vanilla method for the standby action.
4. get in and hit the jetpack button!

[h1] VANILLA BUTTONS SETUP [/h1]
1. get in your cockpit, press G
2. drag the programmable block to the bar and select "RUN"
3. copy & paste the code for your controls. you will need:
[code]
%dampeners
%jetpack
%standby
%raiseAccel
%lowerAccel
%resetAccel [/code]

standby completely stops the script, till you press the button again (and also safely turns off thrusters & rotors) [b] please use it in multiplayer [/b]
the last 3 control your "Target Accel" value and are optional

[h1] CONTROL MODULE [/h1]
 [b] suit jetpack key [/b]:		engines on/off
 [b] inertia dampeners key [/b]:	inertia dampenerse on/off
 [b] + [/b]:			increase target acceleration
 [b] - [/b]:			decrease target acceleration
 [b] 0 [/b]:			reset target acceleration

there is currently no binding for standby, so you will have to set that up with the vanilla method

[h1] INFO PANEL SETUP [/h1]
[b] while this is optional, i highly recommend it [/b]
1. place a text panel
2. put %VectorLCD in the name

[h1] BUGS [/h1]
unfortunately there seems to be a physics bug in space engineers at the moment which causes thrusters on rotors to spaz out in some situations. i have reproduced it on a ship without the script whatsoever, so its not my script doing it

[b] workaround [/b]
so far, i have narrowed it down to the thrusters being in-line with the centre of mass... that's pretty ironic because this update is supposed to remove that requirement.

just try to keep the rotors in-line with the centre of mass and it should be fine
