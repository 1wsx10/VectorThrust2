1. put %VectorTim in the name of the timer block and only put its actions as run the computer with default argument.
2. place the engines while the script is running.
2.5 use the %standby argument to turn the script off (there is no control module hotkey for it yet)
3. no need to do grouping or angles in the name, the script works that out automatically
4. i recommend using control module (see v1 instructions)
5. i recommend using the monitor functionality (see v1 instructions)
